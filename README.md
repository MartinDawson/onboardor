# onboardor
Helps companies create a good on-boarding experience for their developers.

# MVP Manager POV
- Track progress of engineer
  - The expected time to be as productive as the existing engineers
  - The time it takes the engineer to close an issue based on complexity (time estimate) compared to other engineers
  - Log the progress so that the manager can compare each month to see if the engineer is gaining in productivity
  - Log subsequent requests for changes and compare monthly
  - Group by skill level to measure onboarding process
- Onboarding creator
Give multiple options to do things but don't force. 
Create an opinionated onboard creator that has the multiple options of assigning different onboarding task states such as:

- Assign mentor
- Assign group session
- 100% from day one
- Introduce to framework (schedule training etc)

Then start logging the performance so the organizations can see the increase or decrease in productivity.
