Helps companies create a good on-boarding experience for their developers.

# MVP Manager POV
- Track progress of engineer
  - The expected time to be as productive as the existing engineers
  - The time it takes the engineer to close an issue based on complexity (time estimate) compared to other engineers
  - Log the progress so that the manager can compare each month to see if the engineer is gaining in productivity
  - Log subsequent requests for changes and compare monthly
- Compare progress of onboarding techniques
  - Allow the organization to create a checklist of steps for their onboarding process
  - Make each step be easily editable
  - Once the manager edits the checklist, save the old checklist and compare productivity progress for the organizations new onboarding steps
